This repository contains some example C++ code from the \href{simulation-software-engineering.github.io/homepage/}{\texttt{ Simulation Software Engineering}} lecture. It is used in the exercise to generate a documentation website. For more information please check out the \href{https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/04_documentation/tools_exercise.md}{\texttt{ exercise sheet}}.

The code is a slightly modified version of the \href{https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/cmake-exercise}{\texttt{ code used in the C\+Make exercise}} and thus also similar to the code from the \href{https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/03_building_and_packaging/spack_exercise.md}{\texttt{ Spack exercise}}.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{License}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
